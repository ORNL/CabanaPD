# CabanaPD

Peridynamics with the Cabana library

## Dependencies
CabanaPD has the following dependencies:

|Dependency | Version  | Required | Details|
|---------- | -------  |--------  |------- |
|CMake      | 3.11+    | Yes      | Build system
|Cabana     | f99c7db9 | Yes      | Performance portable particle algorithms
|GTest      | 1.10+    | No       | Unit test framework

Cabana must be built with the following in order to work with CabanaPD:
|Cabana Dependency | Version | Required | Details|
|---------- | ------- |--------  |------- |
|CMake      | 3.16+   | Yes      | Build system
|MPI        | GPU-Aware if CUDA/HIP enabled | Yes | Message Passing Interface
|Kokkos     | 3.7.0+  | Yes      | Performance portable on-node parallelism
|HDF5       | master  | No       | Particle output
|SILO       | master  | No       | Particle output

The underlying parallel programming models are available on most systems, as is
CMake. Those must be installed first, if not available. Kokkos and Cabana are
available on some systems or can be installed with `spack` (see
https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html):

```
spack install cabana@master+cajita+silo
```

Alternatively, Kokkos can be built locally, followed by Cabana:
https://github.com/ECP-copa/Cabana/wiki/1-Build-Instructions

Build instructions are available for both CPU and GPU. Note that Cabana must be
compiled with MPI and the Grid sub-package.

## Obtaining CabanaPD

Clone the master branch:

```
git clone https://github.com/ORNL/CabanaPD.git
```

## Build and install
### CPU Build

After building Kokkos and Cabana for CPU, the following script will build and install CabanaPD:

```
#Change directory as needed
export CABANA_DIR=$HOME/Cabana/build/install

cd ./CabanaPD
mkdir build
cd build
pwd
cmake \
    -D CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="$CABANA_DIR" \
    -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=install \
    .. ;
make install
```

### CUDA Build

After building Kokkos and Cabana for Cuda:
https://github.com/ECP-copa/Cabana/wiki/CUDA-Build

The CUDA build script is identical to that above, but again note that Kokkos
must be compiled with the CUDA backend. 

Note that the same compiler should be used for Kokkos, Cabana, and CabanaPD.

### HIP Build

After building Kokkos and Cabana for HIP:
https://github.com/ECP-copa/Cabana/wiki/HIP-and-SYCL-Build#HIP

The HIP build script is identical to that above, except that `hipcc` compiler
must be used:

```
-D CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=hipcc
```

Note that `hipcc` should be used for Kokkos, Cabana, and CabanaPD.

## Tests

Unit tests can be built by updating the CabanaPD CMake configuration in the
script above with:

```
-D CabanaPD_ENABLE_TESTING=ON
```

GTest is required for CabanaPD unit tests, with build instructions
[here](https://github.com/google/googletest). If tests are enabled, you can run
the CabanaPD unit test suite with:

```
cd CabanaPD/build
ctest
```

## Features

CabanaPD currently includes the following:
  - Force models
    - Bond-based (pairwise): prototype microelastic brittle (PMB)
    - State-based (many-body): linear peridynamic solid (LPS)
 - Mechanical response:
   - Elastic (no failure)
   - Brittle fracture
 - Thermomechanics (bond-based only)
   - Optional heat transfer (elastic only)
 - Time integration
   - Velocity Verlet
 - Pre-crack creation
 - Particle boundary conditions
 - Grid-based particle generation supporting custom geometry

## Examples

Once built and installed, CabanaPD `examples/` can be run. Timing and energy
information is output to file and particle output is written to files (if enabled within Cabana) that can be visualized with Paraview and similar applications. 
New examples can be created by using any of the current cases as a template. All inputs are specified in the example JSON files within the relevant `inputs/` subdirectory.

### Mechanics
Examples which only include mechanics and fracture are with `examples/mechanics`.

The first example is an elastic wave propagating through a cube from an initial Gaussian radial displacement profile from [1]. Assuming the build paths above, the example can be run with:

```
./CabanaPD/build/install/bin/ElasticWave CabanaPD/examples/mechanics/inputs/elastic_wave.json
```

The second example is the Kalthoff-Winkler experiment [2], where an impactor
causes crack propagation at an angle from two pre-notches on a steel plate. The
example can be run with:

```
./CabanaPD/build/install/bin/KalthoffWinkler CabanaPD/examples/mechanics/inputs/kalthoff_winkler.json
```

The third example is crack branching in a pre-notched soda-lime glass plate due to traction loading [3]. The example can be run with:

```
./CabanaPD/build/install/bin/CrackBranching CabanaPD/examples/mechanics/inputs/crack_branching.json
```

The fourth example is a fragmenting cylinder due to internal pressure [4]. The example can be run with:

```
./CabanaPD/build/install/bin/FragmentingCylinder CabanaPD/examples/mechanics/inputs/fragmenting_cylinder.json
```

### Thermomechanics
Examples which demonstrate temperature-dependent mechanics and fracture are with `examples/thermomechanics`.

The first example is thermoelastic deformation in a homogeneous plate due to linear thermal loading [5]. The example can be run with:

```
./CabanaPD/build/install/bin/ThermalDeformation CabanaPD/examples/thermomechanics/thermal_deformation.json
```

The second example is crack initiation and propagation in an alumina ceramic plate due to a thermal shock caused by water quenching [6]. The example can be run with:

```
./CabanaPD/build/install/bin/ThermalCrack CabanaPD/examples/thermomechanics/thermal_crack.json
```
